The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason|4.0.1","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report.

","Why the result is missing","Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.","Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""specimen unsatisfactory"".   

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason|4.0.1","",,,,"Observation.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6

One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""test not done"". 

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason|4.0.1","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6

","Extensions that cannot be ignored","May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.

","Why the result is missing","Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.","Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""specimen unsatisfactory"".   

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for null or exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason|4.0.1","",,,,"Observation.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6
